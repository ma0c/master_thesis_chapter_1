\section{Introduction}

Many aspects of speech technologies relies on availability of language resources, for automatic speech recognition and speech synthesis large amounts of annotated data are required to generate acoustic models to recognize and generate voice signals. The Spanish language is one of the top five most spoken languages in the world, behind English and Manadrin, however availability of Open-Sourced speech resources are small compared with other languages like English.

Open-sourced speech resources for the spanish language are studied in this chapter, analysing speakers, lenght, recording conditions, source of language, dialect, format, annotation level and suggested usage.
